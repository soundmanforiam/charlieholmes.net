<h2>Here's a time line of les Paul's life from PBS:</h2><br>
<p>1915- Lester William Polfuss is born June 9 in Waukesha, Wisconsin, to parents George and Evelyn Polfuss.</p><br>
<p>1923-6 - Punches new holes into his mother's player piano rolls, achieving a crude multi-track effect; learns harmonica from an itinerant ditch-digger; builds a crystal radio set and begins weekend studies of sound electronics with WTMJ radio engineer.</p><br>
<p>1927-8 - Receives first guitar - a Sears, Roebuck Troubadour; performs in Waukesha as "Red Hot Red;" meets idols Gene Autry and Pie Plant Pete touring with Chicago's WLS Barn Dance shows; experiments with amplification and electrified guitar at Beekman's Bar-B-Q; builds first disc-cutting lathe with Cadillac flywheel and dental belts; attempts first "solid-body" guitar, using a railroad track strung with wire and a telephone amplifier as the pickup.</p><br>
<p>1927-8- Receives first guitar - a Sears, Roebuck Troubadour; performs in Waukesha as "Red Hot Red;" meets idols Gene Autry and Pie Plant Pete touring with Chicago's WLS Barn Dance shows; experiments with amplification and electrified guitar at Beekman's Bar-B-Q; builds first disc-cutting lathe with Cadillac flywheel and dental belts; attempts first "solid-body" guitar, using a railroad track strung with wire and a telephone amplifier as the pickup.     </p><br>
<p>1929- Joins Rube Tronson and his Texas Cowboys for a summer gig in Escanaba, Michigan, and befriends his mentor and guitar tutor, "Sunny Joe" Wolverton.</p><br>

<p>1933- Rhubarb Red and Sunny Joe move on to Chicago to perform at the World's Fair and then with WBBM, until Paul decides to pursue jazz - living a dual identity as Rhubarb Red on daytime radio and as Les Paul at night, jamming with the jazz greats.</p><br>
<p>1934-6- Forms the Les Paul Trio with Ernie Newton and Jimmie Atkins; makes Decca blues recordings with Georgia White; and begins the first of many solid-body guitar experiments, paying the Larson Brothers $15 to build a single cutaway half-inch maple top, with no f-holes and two pickups.</p><br>
<p>1937- Joins Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians on NBC radio, bringing the sound of the electric guitar to millions of listeners coast to coast.</p><br>

<p>1941- Working weekends at the Epiphone factory in New York City, builds "The Log" by attaching a standard Epiphone neck, strings and wings to a 4x4 board with a pickup. When M. H. Berlin, president of Gibson Guitar's parent company, takes little interest in this "solid-body," Paul braces an Epiphone hollow body with a 3/8-inch steel bar, winds his own super-hot pickups and, for a decade or more, uses "The Klunker" as his primary electrified guitar for performing and recording.</p><br>
